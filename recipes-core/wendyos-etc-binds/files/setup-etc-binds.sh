# This approach matches industry patterns (Docker, CoreOS, Balena) where derived
# identities are computed from persisted seed data.

# Distro profiles live in /usr/lib/NetworkManager/system-connections/ (rootfs,
# read-only, updated on every OTA). User-added/modified profiles live in
# /data/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ (persistent, bind-mounted to /etc).
# NM gives /etc priority over /usr/lib for same-named files.
#
# Problem: if /data has a stale distro copy, it shadows the /usr/lib version
# and blocks OTA updates from taking effect. But if the user intentionally
# modified the profile via nmcli, we must preserve their changes.
#
# Solution: track the distro version hash (like dpkg conffiles). On each boot:
#   - If /data file hash matches the stored distro hash → not user-modified → remove
#   - If /data file hash differs from stored hash → user modified → keep
#   - Update the stored hash from the current /usr/lib version
